# Product Guidelines - Omni Gemini CLI

## Prose Style
- **Professional & Technical:** Use clear, precise language. Favor formal terminology and structured information over conversational filler.
- **Action-Oriented:** Documentation and UI text should focus on enabling the user to complete tasks efficiently.

## Brand Identity & Messaging
- **Integration-First:** Emphasize the "Omni" ecosystem (OmniSync Hub, Android app).
- **Personal & Empowering:** Position the tool as a highly customizable "Power User" extension of the developer's intent.
- **Reliability:** Stress the importance of the robust IPC layer and workspace-aware execution.

## Visual Identity (CLI & Remote)
- **Structured Minimalist:** Use clean, predictable CLI output.
- **Markdown-Rich:** Remote interfaces (Android app) should leverage rich markdown for code diffs, thoughts, and history.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Ensure the "thought streaming" is visually distinct and non-obstructive.
